# Status
This project is in active development, and I'm not organized enough to have a bunch of issues and such yet. 

## Todo:
Rebuild/refactor around the entity ID model
 - refactoring spawn manager to work with entity id
 - fixing lookups to use entity id's instead of indices
 - fix frontend to use entity id instead of player id
